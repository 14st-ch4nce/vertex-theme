###########################
#      Installation       #
###########################
The extracted zip file contains two different subfolders ("Gnome_3-10_Ubuntu_14-04" and "Gnome_3-12") with the GTK themes for the different versions of Gnome/GTK (or the first one for Ubuntu 14.04). Pick the one that matches your version and copy the content to "/usr/share/themes".

To set the right permissions, execute

sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/themes/Vertex

or

sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/themes/Vertex-Light


To set the theme, run the following commands in Terminal,

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Vertex"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Vertex"

for the version with dark header-bars and toolbars or

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Vertex-light"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Vertex-light"

for the light version

To install the Gnome-Shell theme, copy the "Vertex GS" folder to "/usr/share/themes" and set the permissions

sudo chmod -R 755 "/usr/share/themes/Vertex GS"

and apply the theme with 

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name "Vertex GS"

Instead of applying the theme with the gsettings commands you can select them in Gnome Tweak Tool like any other theme.

To install the Chrome/Chromium theme open the "Chrome" folder in the extracted archive and drag and drop the Vertex.crx or Vertex-light.crx file into the Chrome/Chromium window. The source of the Chrome themes is located in the source "Chrome/source" folder 

Also included is an alternative metacity theme with hidden buttons when maximized. Installation is the same as above

#   Troubleshooting   #
#######################

If you get black spaces under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal


If the metacity theme doesn't show up in gnome-tweak-tool copy the theme folder with only the metacity theme inside to ~/.local/share/themes. Otherwise gnome-tweak-tool won't find the metacity theme. (This shouldn't happen if you copy the theme to /usr/share/themes)


You may face the issue that sublime text 2 won't load the theme correctly. This is due to either a bug in sublime or libpng. To fix this, download and extract the sublime-text-fix.tar.gz file and follow the instructions in the included README
